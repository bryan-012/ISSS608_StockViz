Many existing platforms offer complex interfaces, overwhelming users with excessive data and advanced financial tools that are not always necessary for retail investors.\nThe goal of this project is to develop a simple and user-friendly stock portfolio tracking and analysis app using R Shiny. The app will allow users to:\n\nAdd and track stocks in their portfolio.\nView interactive visualizations of stock prices and performance.\nPerform basic technical analysis, such as Exponential Moving Averages (EMA).\nForecast future trends based on historical data.\nKeep the interface lightweight and intuitive, making it accessible to casual investors who wan a hassle-free experience.\n\n\n\n\nTracking a stock portfolio efficiently is often challenging due to :\n\nOverly Complex Tools\n\n\nMany stock tracking platforms are designed for professional traders, making them too advanced for retail investors.\nMany free platforms lack integration of technical analysis tools like EMA in a simple manner.\n\n\nLack of Personalization\n\n\nIf users do not use such app, they often have to manually enter their stocks into spreadsheets to keep track of their portfolio especially if they use multiple trading platforms.\n\n\nNo Forecasting & Basic Technical Analysis\n\n\nMany free tools do not provide predictive insights, such as EMA-based signals or basic forecasting.\n\nHow Our App Solves These Problems\n✔User-friendly Interface: Simple and interactive dashboard for tracking portfolio performance.\n✔Technical Analysis Tools: Integration of EMA, SMA, and trend analysis.\n✔Forecasting Feature: Users can apply time-series forecasting models for price trends.\n✔Custom Portfolio Tracking: Users can add and remove stocks.\n\n\n\nThis project will use real-life stock dataset from Yahoo Finance.\n\nFree\nImpressive range of data\nQuick and easy to set up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsers are able to see an overview of their current portfolio.
