Many existing platforms offer complex interfaces, overwhelming users with excessive data and advanced financial tools that are not always necessary for retail investors.\nThe goal of this project is to develop a simple and user-friendly stock portfolio tracking and analysis app using R Shiny. The app will allow users to:\n\nAdd and track stocks in their portfolio.\nView interactive visualizations of stock prices and performance.\nPerform basic technical analysis, such as Exponential Moving Averages (EMA).\nForecast future trends based on historical data.\nKeep the interface lightweight and intuitive, making it accessible to casual investors who wan a hassle-free experience."
